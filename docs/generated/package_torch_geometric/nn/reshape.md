# reshape

Part of `torch_geometric.nn`
Module: `torch_geometric.nn.reshape`

## Classes (2)

### `Reshape`

Base class for all neural network modules.

Your models should also subclass this class.

Modules can also contain other Modules, allowing them to be nested in
a tree structure. You can assign the submodules as regular attributes::

    import torch.nn as nn
    import torch.nn.functional as F

    class Model(nn.Module):
        def __init__(self) -> None:
            super().__init__()
            self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 20, 5)
            self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(20, 20, 5)

        def forward(self, x):
            x = F.relu(self.conv1(x))
            return F.relu(self.conv2(x))

Submodules assigned in this way will be registered, and will also have their
parameters converted when you call :meth:`to`, etc.

.. note::
    As per the example above, an ``__init__()`` call to the parent class
    must be made before assignment on the child.

:ivar training: Boolean represents whether this module is in training or
                evaluation mode.
:vartype training: bool

#### Methods

- **`forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor`**

### `Tensor`

#### Methods

- **`storage(self)`**
  storage() -> torch.TypedStorage

- **`backward(self, gradient=None, retain_graph=None, create_graph=False, inputs=None)`**
  Computes the gradient of current tensor wrt graph leaves.

- **`register_hook(self, hook)`**
  Registers a backward hook.
