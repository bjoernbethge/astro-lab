# feature_store

Part of `torch_geometric.data`
Module: `torch_geometric.data.feature_store`

## Description

This class defines the abstraction for a backend-agnostic feature store.
The goal of the feature store is to abstract away all node and edge feature
memory management so that varying implementations can allow for independent
scale-out.

This particular feature store abstraction makes a few key assumptions:
* The features we care about storing are node and edge features of a graph.
  To this end, the attributes that the feature store supports include a
  `group_name` (e.g. a heterogeneous node name or a heterogeneous edge type),
  an `attr_name` (e.g. `x` or `edge_attr`), and an index.
* A feature can be uniquely identified from any associated attributes specified
  in `TensorAttr`.

It is the job of a feature store implementor class to handle these assumptions
properly. For example, a simple in-memory feature store implementation may
concatenate all metadata values with a feature index and use this as a unique
index in a KV store. More complicated implementations may choose to partition
features in interesting manners based on the provided metadata.

Major TODOs for future implementation:
* Async `put` and `get` functionality

## Functions (2)

### `abstractmethod(funcobj)`

A decorator indicating abstract methods.

Requires that the metaclass is ABCMeta or derived from it.  A
class that has a metaclass derived from ABCMeta cannot be
instantiated unless all of its abstract methods are overridden.
The abstract methods can be called using any of the normal
'super' call mechanisms.  abstractmethod() may be used to declare
abstract methods for properties and descriptors.

Usage:

    class C(metaclass=ABCMeta):
        @abstractmethod
        def my_abstract_method(self, arg1, arg2, argN):
            ...

### `dataclass(cls=None, /, *, init=True, repr=True, eq=True, order=False, unsafe_hash=False, frozen=False, match_args=True, kw_only=False, slots=False, weakref_slot=False)`

Add dunder methods based on the fields defined in the class.

Examines PEP 526 __annotations__ to determine fields.

If init is true, an __init__() method is added to the class. If repr
is true, a __repr__() method is added. If order is true, rich
comparison dunder methods are added. If unsafe_hash is true, a
__hash__() method is added. If frozen is true, fields may not be
assigned to after instance creation. If match_args is true, the
__match_args__ tuple is added. If kw_only is true, then by default
all fields are keyword-only. If slots is true, a new class with a
__slots__ attribute is returned.

## Classes (9)

### `ABC`

Helper class that provides a standard way to create an ABC using
inheritance.

### `Any`

Special type indicating an unconstrained type.

- Any is compatible with every type.
- Any assumed to have all methods.
- All values assumed to be instances of Any.

Note that all the above statements are true from the point of view of
static type checkers. At runtime, Any should not be used with instance
checks.

### `AttrView`

Defines a view of a :class:`FeatureStore` that is obtained from a
specification of attributes on the feature store. The view stores a
reference to the backing feature store as well as a :class:`TensorAttr`
object that represents the view's state.

Users can create views either using the :class:`AttrView` constructor,
:meth:`FeatureStore.view`, or by incompletely indexing a feature store.
For example, the following calls all create views:

.. code-block:: python

    store[group_name]
    store[group_name].feat
    store[group_name, feat]

While the following calls all materialize those views and produce tensors
by either calling the view or fully-specifying the view:

.. code-block:: python

    store[group_name]()
    store[group_name].feat[index]
    store[group_name, feat][index]

### `CastMixin`

### `Enum`

Create a collection of name/value pairs.

Example enumeration:

>>> class Color(Enum):
...     RED = 1
...     BLUE = 2
...     GREEN = 3

Access them by:

- attribute access::

>>> Color.RED
<Color.RED: 1>

- value lookup:

>>> Color(1)
<Color.RED: 1>

- name lookup:

>>> Color['RED']
<Color.RED: 1>

Enumerations can be iterated over, and know how many members they have:

>>> len(Color)
3

>>> list(Color)
[<Color.RED: 1>, <Color.BLUE: 2>, <Color.GREEN: 3>]

Methods can be added to enumerations, and members can have their own
attributes -- see the documentation for details.

### `FeatureStore`

An abstract base class to access features from a remote feature store.

Args:
    tensor_attr_cls (TensorAttr, optional): A user-defined
        :class:`TensorAttr` class to customize the required attributes and
        their ordering to unique identify tensor values.
        (default: :obj:`None`)

#### Methods

- **`put_tensor(self, tensor: Union[torch.Tensor, numpy.ndarray], *args, **kwargs) -> bool`**
  Synchronously adds a :obj:`tensor` to the :class:`FeatureStore`.

- **`get_tensor(self, *args, convert_type: bool = False, **kwargs) -> Union[torch.Tensor, numpy.ndarray]`**
  Synchronously obtains a :class:`tensor` from the

- **`multi_get_tensor(self, attrs: List[torch_geometric.data.feature_store.TensorAttr], convert_type: bool = False) -> List[Union[torch.Tensor, numpy.ndarray]]`**
  Synchronously obtains a list of tensors from the

### `NodeType`

str(object='') -> str
str(bytes_or_buffer[, encoding[, errors]]) -> str

Create a new string object from the given object. If encoding or
errors is specified, then the object must expose a data buffer
that will be decoded using the given encoding and error handler.
Otherwise, returns the result of object.__str__() (if defined)
or repr(object).
encoding defaults to sys.getdefaultencoding().
errors defaults to 'strict'.

#### Methods

- **`encode(self, /, encoding='utf-8', errors='strict')`**
  Encode the string using the codec registered for encoding.

- **`replace(self, old, new, count=-1, /)`**
  Return a copy with all occurrences of substring old replaced by new.

- **`split(self, /, sep=None, maxsplit=-1)`**
  Return a list of the substrings in the string, using sep as the separator string.

### `Tensor`

#### Methods

- **`storage(self)`**
  storage() -> torch.TypedStorage

- **`backward(self, gradient=None, retain_graph=None, create_graph=False, inputs=None)`**
  Computes the gradient of current tensor wrt graph leaves.

- **`register_hook(self, hook)`**
  Registers a backward hook.

### `TensorAttr`

Defines the attributes of a :class:`FeatureStore` tensor.
It holds all the parameters necessary to uniquely identify a tensor from
the :class:`FeatureStore`.

Note that the order of the attributes is important; this is the order in
which attributes must be provided for indexing calls. :class:`FeatureStore`
implementations can define a different ordering by overriding
:meth:`TensorAttr.__init__`.

#### Methods

- **`is_set(self, key: str) -> bool`**
  Whether an attribute is set in :obj:`TensorAttr`.

- **`is_fully_specified(self) -> bool`**
  Whether the :obj:`TensorAttr` has no unset fields.

- **`fully_specify(self) -> 'TensorAttr'`**
  Sets all :obj:`UNSET` fields to :obj:`None`.
